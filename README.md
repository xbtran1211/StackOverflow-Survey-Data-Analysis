## StackOverflow Survey Data Analysis
I undertook this project as part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, where I: 

- Performed web scraping using BeautifulSoup, learned about HTML components, and GitHub REST APIs.
- Performed comprehensive raw data transformation with Python-based cleaning and wrangling techniques.
- Explored patterns and irregularities through a wide range of data visualisation to uncover insights.
- Built a dashboard in Google Looker Studio and presented findings in PowerPoint.
